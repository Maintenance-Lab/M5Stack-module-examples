# M5Stack Examples
This repository contains example code for each module of the M5Stack device. Each example demonstrates how to use the module's features and provides a starting point for developers to build their own projects. The code is well-documented and easy to follow, making it a great resource for both beginners and experienced users.

## Getting Started 
These examples are designed to be used with the M5Stack development board. Before you begin, make sure that you have the necessary hardware and software set up.

## Contributions
This repository features code created by dedicated students who worked in the maintenance lab of the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. These individuals invested a considerable amount of time and effort in creating these examples, and their hard work shines through in the high-quality code they produced.

## Want to contribute?
- Select a branch..
- - for a designated unit
- - or create one for your project (be aware of the naming convention)
- **Developing for a unit? Use our template:** Excecute make command `make ....`
- Start coding
- Create a *pull request* when you are done
- Is it approved and merged? Awesome, you're helping yourself and others to create more cool stuff with M5Stack!

_A make command still has to be made to generate a template for the unit that you want to add_
